/*
  ColecoVision-only facilities that the cross-platform API has no place for.

  Note that __COLECO__ alone does not mean ColecoVision: z88dk puts it in the
  target-wide OPTIONS line for +coleco, so the Adam subtype defines it too and
  only adds __ADAM__ on top. Anything that must distinguish the two has to test
  defined(__COLECO__) && !defined(__ADAM__).

  One rule this header cannot enforce but every caller must keep: the vblank
  interrupt arrives on the Z80's /NMI, DI will not stop it, and it therefore
  lands in the middle of transactions by design. That is harmless as long as
  the handler never reads $F800 or above -- a register stays armed across an
  interruption and the TX stream is append-only, so an interrupted transaction
  simply resumes. A handler that touches the mailbox pages will corrupt
  whatever transaction it interrupted. Building through
  makefiles/platforms/coleco.mk enforces the other half of the same rule, that
  no code or data of yours lands in $F800-$FFFF.
