/*
  The ColecoVision's half of the FujiNet mailbox.

  These equates mirror fujinet-firmware/pico/coleco/firmware/include/fuji_mailbox.h
  by hand, which is the upstream source of truth; every address here is a
  CONSOLE address, i.e. the image offset plus $8000. Keep the two in step.

  The cartridge connector carries A0-A14, D0-D7, four pre-decoded chip selects
  and power. There is no /RD, /WR or /MREQ, so the cartridge cannot tell a read
  from a write -- which is why every real ColecoVision mapper decodes the
  address. Both directions of the mailbox therefore ride the read path:

    console -> cart   the ADDRESS carries the payload. Reading $FD05 arms
                      register 5; reading $FE2A then sets it to 0x2A. Reading
                      $FF41 appends 'A' to the outgoing stream.
    cart -> console   the cartridge repaints its own ROM, so by the time the
                      Z80 looks, the reply at $F800 is just bytes.

  There is no framing, no checksum and no ACK/NAK exchange on this side. SLIP
  and the end-around-carry checksum live between the RP2040 and the ESP32,
  where the console never sees them.

/* The whole reply in one piece, not a paged 256-byte slice as on the sibling
   cartridge ports. The window is 32K here and the CONSOLE is what is scarce --
   about 700 usable bytes of RAM once the BIOS tables and the stack are paid
   for -- so a reply that can be read in place out of cartridge ROM saves a
   bounce buffer and a polling handshake on every transaction. */

  Every mailbox access is a read whose value we do not want -- the address is
  the message. Writing that as `(void) FN_REGSEL[reg];` looks obviously right
  and is silently wrong: sccz80 emits the address calculation and then throws
  the load away, volatile or not. The generated register write was

      ld de,64768     ; $FD00, computed...
      ld de,65024     ; ...and immediately overwritten by $FE00

  so the REGSEL half never happened, no transaction ever launched, and the
  caller sat polling ACKSEQ forever. Storing the byte somewhere volatile is
  what makes the read a side effect the compiler has to keep. If this is ever
  rewritten, check the generated code with `zcc +coleco -O2 -a` and look for
  two loads, not one.
