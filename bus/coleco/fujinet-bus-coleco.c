  Launch the transaction and wait for the cartridge to publish a reply.

  The sequence number comes from the cartridge's own ACKSEQ + 1, never from a

  everything it owns but does NOT reset the cartridge, so a locally derived
  sequence replays a number the cart has already acknowledged: no request is
  sent, and the stale reply still sitting in the window looks like success.

  The wait loop is deliberately dumb. The cart's own transaction budget is 5s,
  and 60s for MOUNT_IMAGE, so we have to outlast that for a real timeout to
  surface as the cart's error code rather than ours -- but we cannot use a
  timer, because on this machine the timers ride the vblank NMI and a caller
  that has not installed a handler would wait forever on them.

  The FUJI_FIELD_* descriptor maps straight onto the mailbox's parameter
  stream. fuji_field_numbytes() gives the total aux bytes and
  fuji_field_numfields() how many parameters they make up, so their quotient is
  each parameter's size -- always 1, 2 or 4, which is exactly what the stream
  accepts. The DEVCALL_* macros already split wider values low byte first on
  this target (see NATIVE_SPLIT_U16 in fujinet-endian.h), so the aux bytes
  stream through in argument order with no reordering.

  This takes the four aux bytes explicitly rather than through varargs, as adam,
  lynx and msdos do. sccz80 lays a variadic callee's named parameters out as if
  only those had been pushed, but emits calls that push every argument left to
  right, so with DEVCALL_RV's five arguments the callee reads `device` off the
  slot the caller filled with `fields`. The mailbox faithfully forwarded the
  resulting dev=0x10 cmd=0x2F to the ESP32.

  `buf` is the outgoing payload when FUJI_FIELD_DATA is set and the reply
  destination when FUJI_FIELD_REPLY is; no call sets both.
