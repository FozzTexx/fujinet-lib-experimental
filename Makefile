# You can run 'make <platform>' to build for a specific platform,
# or 'make <platform>/<target>' for a platform-specific target.
# Example shortcuts:
#   make coco        → build for coco
#   make apple2/disk → build the 'disk' target for apple2

# SRC_DIRS may use the literal %PLATFORM% token.
# It expands to the chosen PLATFORM plus any of its combos.

# If you need to add extra platform-specific steps, do it below:
#   coco/r2r:: coco/custom-step1
#   coco/r2r:: coco/custom-step2
# or
#   apple2/disk: apple2/custom-step1 apple2/custom-step2
